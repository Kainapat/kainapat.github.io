				<h2><b>WHAT IS COMPUTER?</b></h2>
				<p>A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information
					processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on
					it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these
					processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as
					memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is
					called output.</p>
				<h2><b>HOW DOES A COMPUTER WORK?</b></h2>
				<p>A computer processes the input to produce the desired output, but how does a machine outperform the
					human brain? Conventional computers don't try to mimic the human brain. Instead, they run commands
					sequentially, with data constantly moving from input and memory to the device's processor.
					Neuromorphic computers, on the other hand, process data at the same time, making them faster,
					energy-efficient, and closer to the structure of the human brain.</p>
				<span class="image LEFT"><img src="images/com.jfif" alt="" width="400" height="550" /></span><br>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Input</b><br> Input is the data before processing. It comes from the mouse, keyboard,
						microphone, and other external sensors.</li>
					<li><b>Storage</b><br>The storage is how the computer retains input data. The hard drive is used for
						long-term and mass data storage while the data set for immediate processing is stored
						temporarily in the Random Access Memory (RAM).</li>
					<li><b>Processing</b><br>Processing is where input gets transformed into output. The computer's
						Central Processing Unit (CPU) is its brain. It's responsible for executing instructions and
						performing mathematical operations on the input data.</li>
					<li><b>Output</b><br>Output is the final result of data processing. It can be anything from images,
						video, or audio content, even the words you type using a keyboard. You can also receive the
						output through a printer or a projector instead of directly through your device.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2><b>SOFTWARE?</b></h2>
				<p>Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. This is in contrast to
					hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.</p>

				<h2><b>SYSTEM SOFTWARE</b></h2>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Operating Systems</b><br>Windows, Mac Os, Linux</li>
					<li><b>Utility Programs</b><br>Compression, Virus scanners, Back up</li>
					<li><b>Software Development</b><br>Assemblers, Compilers, Interpreter</li>
				</ol>
				<h2><b>APPLICATION SOFTWARE</b></h2>
				<p><b>Example Application:</b> Microsoft word, PowerPoint, Excel, Photoshop</p>
				<h2><b>HOW COMPUTER STORE DATA?</b></h2>
				<p>All data stored on storage media – whether that’s hard disk drives (HDDs), solid state drives (SSDs),
					external hard drives, USB flash drives, SD cards etc – can be converted to a string of bits,
					otherwise known as binary digits. These binary digits have a value of 1 or 0, and the strings can
					make up photos, documents, audio and video. A byte is the most common unit of storage and is equal
					to 8 bits.</p>
				<p>All data in a computer is stored as a number. For example, letters become numbers; the Complete Works
					of Shakespeare is around 1250 pages in print, contains 40 million bits, with one byte per letter,
					totalling five megabytes (5MB). Photographs are converted to a set of numbers that indicate the
					location, colour and brightness of each pixel. Whereas convention numbers use ten digits (0, 1, 2,
					3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), binary numbers use two digits to represent all possible values. The
					conventions numbers 0-8 translate into binary numbers as: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111 and 1000.
					With binary numbers, any value can be stored as a series of items which are either true (1) or false
					(0).</p>
				<p>Binary data is primarily stored on the hard disk drive (HDD). The device is made up of a spinning
					disk (or disks) with magnetic coatings and heads that can both read and write information in the
					form of magnetic patterns. In addition to hard disk drives, floppy disks and tapes also store data
					magnetically. Newer laptops, as well as mobile phones, tablets, USB flash drives and SD cards, use
					solid state (or flash) storage. With this storage medium, the binary numbers are instead stored as a
					series of electrical charges within the NAND flash chips. Because all data is made up of a string of
					binary numbers, just one number out of place can cause a file to become corrupt.</p>

				<h2><b>HOW PROGRAM WORK?</b></h2>
				<p>The CPU runs instructions using a "fetch-execute" cycle: the CPU gets the first instruction in the
					sequence, executes it (adding two numbers or whatever), then fetches the next instruction and
					executes it, and so on. Some of the instructions affect the order that the CPU takes through the
					instruction sequence. For example, an instruction might direct the CPU to jump back to an earlier
					point in the instruction sequence (loops are implemented this way), or to skip over the next
					instruction if a particular condition is true (if-statements are implemented this way).</p>
				<h3><b>What is Fetch - Decode - Execute - Cycle</b></h3>

					<h2><b>Assembly language</b></h2>
					<p>In computer programming, assembly language, often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly
						abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong
						correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code
						instructions. Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but
						constants, comments, assembler directives, symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations,
						registers, and macros are generally also supported.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/assembly.png" alt="" </span><br>
						<h2><b>High level language</b></h2>
						<p>In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong
							abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming
							languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even
							hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the
							process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a
							lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a
							programming language is.</p>
						<h2><b>Programing language</b></h2>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/codelanguage.jfif" alt="" </span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/codelanguage2.jfif" alt="" </span><br>
								<h2><b>Compiler</b></h2>
								<p>A compiler is a program that translates a source language or high-level programming
									language (for example, Java, C++) into a target machine code (binary bits – 1 and 0)
									that the CPU can process and understand. The program to be translated is written
									inside an editor and are known as source statements. The act of translating source
									code to machine or binary code is known as compilation.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/compiler.jfif" alt="" </span><br>
									<h2><b>Interpreter</b></h2>
									<p>An interpreter is a program which also converts a high-level programming language
										(like Python, PHP, Perl) into machine code. Although similar to a compiler, the
										way that code is executed is different for both. Unlike a compiler that simply
										converts the source code to machine code, an interpreter can be run directly as
										an executable program. Contrary to a compiler, it converts source code to
										machine code when the program is running and not before the program runs.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/interpreter.jfif" alt="" </span><br>
										<h2><b>PROGRAM DISIGN</b></h2>
										<h3>Program development cycle</h3>
										<p>is Programming Development Cycle is a model which is used to represent the
											stages and tasks that are included orderly in each step to write and put
											software.</p>
										<p>From the initial process of planning, the particular software can be used as
											a product in long-term usage by implementation and continuation and used as
											a completed software application. The Programming Development Cycle contains
											step by steps like analysis which is a requirement.</p>
										<p>It also designs the solution and after that validates and implements the
											design. Then test and document the solution. In the below section, you will
											understand what are the stages or cycles of Programming Development.</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/develop cycle.jfif" alt=""
												</span><br>
											<h2><b>Designing a Program</b></h2>
											<ol>
												<li>Understanding the Program</li>
												<li>Using Design Tools to Create a Model</li>
												<li>Develop Test Data</li>
											</ol>
											<h2><b>Pseudocode</b></h2>
											<p>In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the
												steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses
												structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended
												for human reading rather than machine reading. It typically omits
												details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm,
												such as variable declarations and language-specific code. The
												programming language is augmented with natural language description
												details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation. The
												purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to
												understand than conventional programming language code, and that it is
												an efficient and environment-independent description of the key
												principles of an algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks and
												scientific publications to document algorithms and in planning of
												software and other algorithms.</p>
											<h2><b>FLOWCHART</b></h2>
											<p>A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A
												flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an
												algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart
												shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting
												the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a
												solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing,
												designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various
												fields.</p>
											<h3><b>How FlowChart important?</b></h3>
											<p>Flow charts are an important tool for the improvement of processes. By
												providing a graphical representation, they help project teams to
												identify the different elements of a process and understand the
												interrelationships among the various steps.</p>

													<h2><b>IPO OR INPUT PROCESS OUTPUT</b></h2>
													<p>Computer programs typically perform the following three-step
														process:</p>
													<ol>
														<li>Input is received.</li>
														<li>Some process is performed on the input.</li>
														<li>Outputis produced.</li>
													</ol>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/data/ipo.jfif" alt="" </span><br>
											<h2><b>VARIABLES</b></h2>
											<p>Variable are: Storage location that have a name, Name-value pairs</p>
